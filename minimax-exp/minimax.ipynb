      "We need to respond with a thorough explanation of likelihood and probability, differentiating them. Should be in math language, perhaps also statistics perspective. The user is just asking \"What is likelihood and probability?\" So we can provide definitions, examples, interpretations, the difference between likelihood of a parameter given data vs probability of data given parameter. Provide formulas, mention that both are functions of data/parameter. Mention that probability distributions and likelihood function. Provide examples: coin toss, normal distribution. Clarify that likelihood is not a probability measure over parameter space; it's only defined up to a constant factor; it's a function of parameters for observed data. Provide interpretation: probability quantifies the chance of an outcome from a known model; likelihood quantifies support for model parameters given observed data. Also mention uses: parameter estimation, hypothesis testing, Bayesian inference, etc. Provide some graphical intuition: likelihood curves.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can also discuss Bayesian vs frequentist approach: In Bayesian inference, we treat parameters as random variables and compute posterior distribution, which involves likelihood. In frequentist, we maximize likelihood (MLE). Provide references. Also note the difference in notation: L(θ|x) vs p(x|θ).\n",
      "\n",
      "Potential pitfalls: People often confuse likelihood with probability, but they are distinct. Also difference between \"likelihood\" being a function of the parameter for fixed data vs \"probability\" being a function of data for fixed parameter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus answer: define both in formal terms, give formulas, illustrate with examples. Then talk about uses and differences.\n",

      "Make answer accessible but rigorous. The user might not have advanced math, so keep it clear but precise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus the final answer will be a thorough explanation. Also keep it limited to mathematics and stats. No other content. Use LaTeX for formulas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also talk about the distinction between \"likelihood\" and \"probability density\". Provide that likelihood can be computed for discrete and continuous distributions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Add note that likelihood does not satisfy the axioms of probability because its values need not sum to 1 over the parameter space.\n",
      "\n",
      "Provide an example with a binomial model: Suppose we toss a coin n times and get k heads. Probability of observed data given p (coin bias) is p^k (1-p)^{n-k}. For fixed data, the likelihood function L(p) = p^k (1-p)^{n-k} as a function of p. It is not a probability density over p, but we can use it to find the p that maximizes it, which is the MLE = k/n.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also continuous example: suppose data X_i ~ N(μ, σ^2). Then L(μ) = ∏ (1/√(2πσ^2)) exp(-(x_i - μ)^2/(2σ^2)). The MLE for μ is the sample mean.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also mention \"likelihood ratio\" and \"likelihood function\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Add note that \"likelihood\" can be extended to the concept of \"likelihood function\" over parameter space.\n",
      "\n",
      "We could also discuss that in Bayesian inference, we combine prior π(θ) and likelihood to get posterior p(θ|x) ∝ π(θ) L(θ|x). This shows how likelihood is used.\n",
